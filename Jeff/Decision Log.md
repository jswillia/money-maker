## Decisions

### Feb 19, 2026 — Project Inception

**Decision:** Launched Money Maker project — $100 investment into automated revenue strategies.

**Context:** Research across 6 domains, 30+ strategies evaluated, 5 expert panels scored independently. 5 strategy playbooks created as shared intelligence.

**Reasoning:** Portfolio approach diversifies risk. Shared intelligence layer with Patrick means both partners benefit from research while running independent stacks.

**Outcome:** TBD — choosing strategies and beginning execution.

### Feb 19, 2026 — Independent Partner Model

**Decision:** Structured project as shared intelligence + independent execution rather than shared revenue splits.

**Context:** Patrick joining as second investor. Needed to decide on collaboration model.

**Alternatives:** Shared everything (50/50 split), completely separate projects, shared revenue model.

**Reasoning:** Shared intelligence means research benefits everyone. Independent execution means each partner can choose their own strategies, move at their own pace, and own 100% of what they build. Shared n8n infrastructure keeps costs low. Patrick supplies his own API keys.

**Outcome:** Vault restructured to support independent stacks.
