# Money Maker — Dashboard

> **Mission:** Two partners each invest $100, building automated revenue systems independently — sharing intelligence, not revenue.
> **Model:** Shared research + shared infrastructure. Independent strategies, capital, and revenue.
> **Constraint:** <1 hour/week human time per partner. Claude Code builds. n8n automates. Systems learn from each other.

## Strategy Playbooks (Shared)

These are shared "how-to" guides. Each partner independently decides which strategies to pursue.

| # | Playbook | Capital Required | Risk | Expert Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [[Strategy 1 - Gumroad Digital Products]] | $0 | Low | 12 pts (3/5 panels) |
| 2 | [[Strategy 2 - Kalshi Weather Bot]] | $25 | Moderate | 11 pts (3/5 panels) |
| 3 | [[Strategy 3 - n8n Workflow Templates]] | $0 | Very Low | 9 pts (3/5 panels) |
| 4 | [[Strategy 4 - AI Micro-SaaS]] | $0-35 | Moderate | 7 pts (4/5 panels) |
| 5 | [[Strategy 5 - Prediction Market Arb]] | $25 | Low-Moderate | 7 pts (2/5 panels) |

> Partners can run the same strategies or different ones. Running the same strategy on separate accounts is fine — you're not competing, you're learning from each other.
