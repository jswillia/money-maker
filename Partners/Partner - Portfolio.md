## Cost Sharing Arrangement

> Defined in [[Operations Guide]] — Partner pays proportional API costs monthly.

| Item | Split | Jeff Pays | Partner Pays |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude API | 50/50 | 50% | 50% |
| Infrastructure (n8n, Mac Mini) | Jeff covers | 100% | 0% |
| Domain costs | 50/50 | 50% | 50% |
| Trading capital | Separate | Own $50 | Own $50 |
| Product revenue | 50/50 | 50% | 50% |

## Notes

- Does NOT need their own infrastructure — uses Jeff's n8n/Mac Mini
- Needs own Kalshi + Polymarket accounts (regulatory requirement)
- Revenue from shared products (Gumroad, SaaS) split 50/50
- Trading profits belong to whoever's capital is deployed
