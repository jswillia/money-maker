## Decisions

### Feb 19, 2026 — Strategy Selection

**Decision:** Selected 5-strategy portfolio: Gumroad products, Kalshi weather bot, n8n templates, AI micro-SaaS, prediction market arb.

**Context:** 6 research domains explored, 30+ strategies evaluated, 5 expert panels scored independently.

**Alternatives:** Telegram bots (6 pts), MCP servers (5 pts, #1 by First-Mover panel), Chrome extension (5 pts, #1 by Risk panel), Newsletter (3 pts), EU AI Act compliance tool (2 pts).

**Reasoning:** Top 5 by weighted cross-panel consensus. Portfolio diversified across capital compounding, audience compounding, and product compounding curves. Zero-risk strategies (#1, #3) balance higher-variance strategies (#2, #4, #5).

**Outcome:** TBD — execution begins.

### Feb 19, 2026 — Vault Creation

**Decision:** Created dedicated Obsidian vault as project command center, shared via git.

**Context:** Need centralized knowledge base accessible to both partners, tracking all strategies, research, and operational procedures.

**Reasoning:** Git-based sharing allows version control, collaboration, and access from any machine with the repo cloned.

**Outcome:** Vault created at `/Users/jeffdev/dev/git/money-maker/`.
