## Decisions

### Feb 19, 2026 — Strategy Playbook Selection

**Decision:** Selected 5-strategy playbook portfolio: Gumroad products, Kalshi weather bot, n8n templates, AI micro-SaaS, prediction market arb.

**Context:** 6 research domains explored, 30+ strategies evaluated, 5 expert panels scored independently.

**Reasoning:** Top 5 by weighted cross-panel consensus. Playbooks are shared knowledge — each partner independently chooses which to pursue.

### Feb 19, 2026 — Vault Creation

**Decision:** Created dedicated Obsidian vault as project command center, shared via git.

**Context:** Need centralized knowledge base accessible to both partners.

**Reasoning:** Git-based sharing allows version control, collaboration, and access from any machine.

### Feb 19, 2026 — Independent Execution Model

**Decision:** Restructured from "shared revenue, 50/50 split" to "shared intelligence, independent execution."

**Context:** Two partners each investing $100. Need collaboration model that maximizes learning while minimizing friction.

**Alternatives:** Shared everything (50/50 split), completely separate projects, hybrid models.

**Reasoning:** Shared intelligence means research, playbooks, and opportunity scanning benefit everyone. Independent execution means each partner controls their own strategies, capital, and revenue. No disagreements on priority, no messy accounting. Each partner's n8n workflows use their own credentials.
