## Overview

Zero cost, zero risk, infinite ROI. Claude Code is building n8n workflows for the other strategies anyway — every workflow is a potential template product. The marginal cost of productizing a workflow we already built is near zero.

## Market Context

- n8n raised $180M at $2.5B valuation (Oct 2025)
- 230K+ users, 8,344 free templates, 5,648 AI-specific workflows
- Paid template market is brand new — category leaders not yet established
- n8n may launch an official paid marketplace in 2026

```

## Revenue Projections

$50-$400 in 6 months with $0 capital deployed. Lower absolute, but **infinite ROI**.

## Circuit Breakers

- If zero sales after 6 weeks → stop creating new templates, focus elsewhere
- Never pay for promotion — rely on organic (n8n community, Reddit, social)
