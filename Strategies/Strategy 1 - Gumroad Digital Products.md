## Overview

Digital products have zero marginal cost after creation. Claude Code creates each product, Gumroad handles payments and delivery. Every sale is nearly 100% profit. Two compounding loops run simultaneously: ad spend ROAS compounding + catalog organic discovery compounding.

## Products to Build

Claude Code creates these in batches of 3-5:

| Category | Examples | Price Range |
|---|---|---|
| Developer tool kits | CLAUDE.md templates, VS Code configs, dev environment setups | $9-$19 |
| AI prompt packs | Industry-specific prompt libraries for Claude/GPT | $7-$15 |
| Notion/Obsidian templates | Productivity systems, project management, habit trackers | $5-$12 |
| Code boilerplates | Next.js starters, API templates, automation scripts | $15-$29 |
| n8n workflow guides | Documentation + workflow JSON bundles | $9-$19 |

## Compounding Mechanism

```
Claude Code creates product → Launch on Gumroad (free) →
First organic sales → Revenue reinvested into ads →
Ads generate more sales → More revenue → More ad spend +
Claude Code creates NEXT product → Larger catalog attracts
more organic traffic → More cross-selling → Repeat
```

## Revenue Projections

| Month | Products | Revenue | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3-5 | $0-$80 | $40 |
| 2 | 5-8 | $20-$160 | $130 |
| 3 | 8-12 | $50-$300 | $305 |
| 4 | 12-16 | $80-$500 | $595 |
| 5 | 16-18 | $120-$700 | $1,005 |
| 6 | 18-20 | $150-$900 | $1,530 |

**Asset value at month 6:** Storefront with 20 products doing $600-$900/month = sellable for 6-24x = **$3,600-$21,600**.

## Circuit Breakers

- If a product gets zero sales in 3 weeks → stop promoting, build the next one
- Never spend on ads until a product has 10+ organic sales proving demand
- If Gumroad changes fee structure → migrate to LemonSqueezy or Payhip
